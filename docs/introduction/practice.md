## Which package?

Largely this is a question of where you find yourself.  The kind of spreadsheet
editing we are going to do will work equally well in some overpriced behemoth
like *Excel* or something feather light like *Gnumeric*.  With a bit of adaption
it will work in *Emacs Org-Mode*.

Use whichever program you will continue to use.  If you do not have a
spreadsheet package installed and have a good internet connection, use Google
Sheets.  Otherwise install *Libre Office* and use *Calc*.

Load up your spreadsheet package.  Most of your screen should be little
rectangles: these are called *cells*.  Cells come in *rows* and *columns*.  By
convention columns are lettered and rows are numbered.  Thus the first cell is
`A1`, the one to the right of it `B1`, the one below it `A2`, and so on.  If you
click in a cell you can normally type directly into it.  But somewhere along the
top of the screen---normally directly above the cells (the *sheet*) is a long
text input field, called the *formula bar*.  Here you can type and what you type
will appear in the cell (often: once you press enter or click on the 'tick' to
the right hand side of the bar).

Along the top of the screen there *might* be menus, but Micro$oft has started
replacing them with a 'ribbon' which functions like a kind of menu expanded in
lots of directions and entirely lacking in hierarchy (you may have gathered I
don't like ribbon layouts).

Along the bottom of the screen are some tabs.  The first of these should be
selected.  These allow you to switch (and create) *sheets*.

!!! Example "Exercise"

    Type something into cell A1. Now click on the little tab
    to the right of the tab for this sheet at the bottom. (You may instead have
    to click and make a new sheet.) Notice how the sheet is cleared.  Type
    something else into cell A1.  Switch back to the first sheet and notice how
    it changes.
