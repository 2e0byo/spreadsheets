## Pivot Tables

A 'pivot' table is a kind of summary table where the spreadsheet package
counts things up for you.  The name is rather misleading, but there is a good
[wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pivot_table) with examples
which says it clearer than I can here.

## Outgoings

Create a new sheet, called `Outgoing Pivot`.  Now we are going to create a pivot
table in it.  We want it to answer the question:  How much did Bob spend on each
*category* for a given *week*?

Thus the final, dynamic table, will look like this:

| Category  | week1 | week 2 | week3 |
|-----------|-------|--------|-------|
| Motoring  | total | total  | total |
| Groceries | total | total  | total |

Except with real data values.

This is likely to take a while; you may need some googling (or some help from
someone else).
