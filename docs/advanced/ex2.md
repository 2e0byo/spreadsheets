The first step is to get all your data into one spreadsheet.

1. Import all Bob's Outgoings into one sheet and sort the data by the date.  Use
   a column for 'description', a column for 'date', and a column for 'amount'.

2. Now import Bob's Incomings into *separate* sheets. Format the date column as
   a real date where I used the day of the year as a number.

3. Combine all the Incomings into an 'Incomings' sheet by *referencing* values
   in the individual sheets into individual column (one for each sheet) and then
   total them in a 'total' column.
   
4. Apply appropriate formats all round.
??? Tip

    Sorting data is the spreadsheet package's job, not yours!  Look up how to do
    it if you don't know.
