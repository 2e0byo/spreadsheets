## Next steps

Hopefully this will have got you going with spreadsheets.  Remember they are a
*tool*, not a whole prepackaged solution in and of themselves.  Nevertheless
they are a very powerful tool.

You might want to look at:

- The function (formula) list of your particular package, to see what can be
  done.
- Charting options.
- Exporting/importing.
- Integrating with a database/financial package.
- Scanning existing paper documents and importing data (this is massively
  time-consuming to automate, unless a ready-rolled solution exits).
- Macros.  You don't need them, though.  Learn a decent programming language
  instead, like Python.
