## Enlarging

Bob is starting to think you might be worth it.  Make this spreadsheet work
for a whole month, with a column for weekly totals.

!!! Tip

    You should be able largely just to autofill.  But think about how you will
    check that everything has worked.


## Formatting

Bob wants the colours to follow a threshold he sets in the corner of the
spreadsheet.  He can then use the thresholds to colour different kinds of
expenditure and use that to see where he's going.  Make two cells, one for
big outgoings (to colour red) and the other for big incomings (to colour
green).  Set up the formatting to use the values of these cells.


??? Hint

    You might need an intermediate column.
    
Now make sure the spreadsheet can be scrolled without the column header
changing.  Format the column headers appropriately.  Also think about the best
place to put the constants: would it make more sense to put them on another
sheet?  How will you reference another sheet?  How would someone else discover
how to make sense of your spreadsheet?

!!! Tip

    Always design for someone else who encounters your work for the first time.
    That way when you come back in a year or so you will be able to work out how
    your spreadsheets work.  If necessary, add explanatory notes.
