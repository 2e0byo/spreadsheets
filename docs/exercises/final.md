## Enlarging

Bob is starting to think you might be worth it.  Make this spreadsheet work
for a whole month, with a column for weekly totals.  [You should be able
largely just to drag].




## Formatting

Bob wants the colours to follow a threshold he sets in the corner of the
spreadsheet.  He can then use the thresholds to colour different kinds of
expenditure and use that to see where he&rsquo;s going.  Make two cells, one for
big outgoings (to colour red) and the other for big incomings (to colour
green).  Set up the formatting to use the values of these cells.  [Hint: you
might need an intermediate column.]
