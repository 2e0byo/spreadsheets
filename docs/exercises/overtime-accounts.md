Bob is impressed with your calculator, but doesn't like it being separate.
He wants to have a bunch of columns in his weekly spreadsheet, one for each
source of income, and he wants to be able to enter the number of **hours** in
each for the given rate, and be told how much he earned that day.  He wants
the column for his job to take overtime into account.  Make such a
spreadsheet.
