    At this point we are putting everything together.  Have a look at your
    previous spreadsheets as you go along.

Bob is impressed with your calculator, but doesn't like it being separate.
He wants to have a bunch of rows in his weekly spreadsheet, one for each day of the week, and a column for each
source of income, and he wants to be able to enter the number of **hours** in
each for the given rate, and be told how much he earned that day.  He wants
the column for his job to take overtime into account.  Make such a
spreadsheet.

    Previously your columns were manually entered.  Now they will be calculated.
    Be careful to use invariant referencing with `$` for the hourly rates,
    otherwise when you autofill the calculation will fail.
