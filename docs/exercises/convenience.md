## Convenience

Bob is lazy.  Also, his psychiatrist told him typing risks disturbing his
Oedipus complex.  Bob is not quite convinced that his computer really is his
mother and occasionally wonders if the psychiatrist is worth the money he
pays, but he decides to get you to modify the spreadsheet.  For his day job
only, if he enters **nothing** Monday to Friday, he should earn his daily
salary.  If he enters anything else, he should earn that number of hours' pay
(taking into account overtime as before).  But for Saturday and Sunday he
should enter nothing and earn nothing (Bob doesn't work saturday and Sunday
at his day job).  Also it should still highlight as before.
