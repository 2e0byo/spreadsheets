Bob is even more impressed.  He plans to ask about tax soon.  That shows he's
really impressed, because he doesn't trust anyone, so he never talks about
tax.  (Bob is rather paranoid about tax, and thinks HMRC are **actually**
vampires.  He carries a garlic-soaked cocktail stick he nicked from a bowl of
olives in his jacket pocket, just in case.)

Bob sometimes works overtime, to get even **more** money.  However, because
he's bad at accounts, he doesn't record the amount of overtime he's done.  He
just records the **total** amount, and wants you to make a calculator.

Bob's hours are 9-5 with an hour off for lunch.  Anything more is overtime.
Overtime is paid at 177% his hourly rate (which is still Â£35/hour after tax).
Make a calculator spreadsheet where Bob can enter the amount of hours he worked
in a given day and be told how much he will earn.

!!! Tip

    Parametrise your calculation.  (i.e. put the overtime rate in a cell where
    it can be modified.)
    
    Use invariant referencing with `$` so you can drag-complete multiple lines.
    
??? Help

    If stuck, think about what you want the output to look like.  Make a mockup.
    Then think about where the numbers come from, and replace them with
    calculations.
    
    If you need to, review the sections on spreadsheet maths and formulas.
