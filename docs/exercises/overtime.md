## Overtime

Bob is even more impressed.  He plans to ask about tax soon.  That shows he&rsquo;s
really impressed, because he doesn&rsquo;t trust anyone, so he never talks about
tax.  (Bob is rather paranoid about tax, and thinks the IRS are **actually**
vampires.  He carries a garlic-soaked cocktail stick he nicked from a bowl of
olives in his jacket pocket, just in case.)

Bob sometimes works overtime, to get even **more** money.  However, because
he&rsquo;s bad at accounts, he doesn&rsquo;t record the amount of overtime he&rsquo;s done.  He
just records the **total** amount, and wants you to make a calculator.

Bob&rsquo;s hours are 9-5 with an hour off for lunch.  Anything more is overtime.
Overtime is paid at 177% his hourly rate (which is still Â£25/hour after tax).
Make a calculator spreadsheet where Bob can enter an amount of hours and be
told how much he will earn.
