Bob is impressed.  But your spreadsheet is boring, and a bit hard to read.
Bob wants it to be colourful: if he earns a particularly large sum he wants
it to be in green, and if he spends a particularly large amount he wants it
to be in **BOLD RED**. (His psychiatrist, whom he saw for £678 last month, tells
him colours will make his life come alive.  His psychiatrist also needs an
accountant, but it is not the only help the poor man needs.)

!!! Note

    Bob hasn't told you to enter the psychiatrist's amount.  But as a good
    accountant you should make a mental note that this is another outgoing.
    Think now: how would you adapt your sheet to add another monthly bill?

Change your spreadsheet so incomings greater than £75 (in one day) are
highlighted in green, and outgoings greater than £60 are in bold red.  Bob
will test that you have really done it by changing some numbers: the red and
green should come and go as the numbers change.
