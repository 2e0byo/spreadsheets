## Hello to Bob

It is time to introduce you to Bob.  Bob will have a lot to say (generally in
the imperative) for the rest of this course.  But it's a good idea to get an
idea of him in advance.

Here is a picture of Bob, camping:

<!-- Primus image here. -->

Bob dresses like this every time he goes camping.  He never dresses like this at
any other point.  This tells you a lot about Bob.

Here is another photo of Bob:

This photo is on file with the Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs.  Bob doesn't
know that it exists, but if he did he would be even more keen to hire you.

## Following these exercises

Each exercise builds on the previous.  I suggest you make a folder (or
directory) for them, and name your first spreadsheet something like `ex1.ods`.
Then when working on the second exercise, save-as `ex2.ods` (etc).  Be careful
not to overwrite your previous work: you will likely want it for reference.
