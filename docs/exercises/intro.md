# Hello to Bob

It is time to introduce you to Bob.  Bob will have a lot to say (generally in
the imperative) for the rest of this course.  But it's a good idea to get an
idea of him in advance.

Here is a picture of Bob, camping:

<!-- Primus image here. -->

Bob dresses like this every time he goes camping.  He never dresses like this at
any other point.  This tells you a lot about Bob.

# Following these exercises

Each exercise builds on the previous.  I suggest you make a folder (or
directory) for them, and name your first spreadsheet something like `ex1.ods`.
Then when working on the second exercise, save-as `ex2.ods` (etc).  Be careful
not to overwrite your previous work: you will likely want it for reference.
