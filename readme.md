# Bob's Guide to Spreadsheets

This is a basic spreadsheet course.  It was initially written for my wife, who
wanted an introductory guide, when I couldn't find anything I liked on the
internet.

It has since been published online under the MIT license in case anyone else
finds it useful, and because I have the sneaking suspicion it's not the last
time anyone will ask me about spreadsheets.

It covers basic concepts, with a set of graded exercises to let you practice.
Rather than providing answers, it aims to give you the right questions.

You will notice there is nothing about macros, pivot/hookup-lookup tables etc.
This is because I consider those things to be (generally) poor substitutes for a
real programming language.

If you want to do something difficult, learn a bit of python.  You can easily
pass your sheets through to a more capable environment.

Lastly this course is by definition opinionated.  But if you think it can be
improved, I am open to suggestions.
